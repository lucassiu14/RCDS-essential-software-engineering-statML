    "\n",
    "Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which can run on your computer, or remotely, such as in a GitHub codespace. It is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes. As such, it is a powerful and popular tool for writing code."

You can access the Marketplace by clicking on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar on the left or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`. If you're looking at these notes on a Codespace, there should already be some extensions installed.\n",

Typically, you will open a fodler that contains a project you're working on by clicking on the \"Open Folder\" button on the welcome screen or by selecting \"File\" -> \"Open Folder\" from the menu."

    "\n",
    "* Create a `.py` file in the Explorer view by right-clicking on the folder and selecting \"New File\". Name it `hello.py`.\n",
    "* Start typing `print`. You will see a dropdown window with suggestions. You can press tab to select and insert the top suggestion, or scroll through them with the arrow keys. This is called autocompletion. \n",
    "* Complete the line with `print(\"Hello, World!\")`.\n",
    "* Hover over the `print` function. You will see a popup with information about the function. This is known as intelli-sense in VS Code. It can be a quick way to get information on the functions you are using.\n",
    "* Note the different colours of the text. This is called syntax highlighting. It can help you to quickly identify different parts of your code.\n",
    "* Write another print statement `print((1 + 2) * 3)`. Note, as you create open brackets, VS Code automatically creates the closed brackets.\n",
    "* Note the brackets are colour-coded to help spot which brackets match.\n",
    "* Delete the bracket after the 2. Note the squiggly lines which appears, letting you know there is an error. Hover over the squiggly line to see a brief error message.\n",
    "* At the top-right of the window click the \"Play\" button. Observe the output of the code in the terminal.\n",
    "* The terminal is a convenient place to access the command line in your OS. You can run commands here, such as `python hello.py` to run your Python program."
